# top-etch-a-sketch

This project tends to recapitulate basic concepts of html, css and javascript
which were dealt with throughout the curriculum of The Odin Project (TOP) up to
this point.

It focuses in particular on the Document Object Model (DOM) and events.

Goal is to create a sketch pad which allows the user to create a grid structure
and change the color of each single grid by hovering over it with the mouse.
